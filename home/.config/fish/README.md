# fish

## Why

Just a bit settings, many benefits.

## Philosophy

Only pure fish script.
Because if I use a plugin manager it will be difficult to management and it will take time to switch plugin managers.

## What is `secret.fish`

A file for adding aliases, functions and more that I want to keep secret.
If I have a lot of secrets, Use `secret.fish` as an entry file for `*.secret.fish`.
